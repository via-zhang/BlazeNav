# BlazeNav
Team project for Data Structures and Algorithms, Spring 2025:
Comparing Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra's Algorithms to find the shortest path between the Gainesville Fire Station #1 and a user-inputted fire location.

The **BlazeNav.ipynb** is the main Jupyter Notebook that hosts the main project and functions. The dijkstra.py and bellmanford.py files provide supplementary code that focuses on each algorithm.
